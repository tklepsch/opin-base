When working on javascript files, we want to compress the files after we are finished with them.

To do this, run ‘gulp compress’ in the assets folder. 

This will reduce the file size of the javascript file and create a minified version of the file. In libraries.yml, make sure the minified file is being served to the browser after you are done.
